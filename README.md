# My First README.md
## Rachel Hofer
### *This assingment was a little difficult because I am learning this program for the first time and haven't done this since high school. So things are a bit tricky, but I am starting to get the hang of it.*
#### ** Even though this class is a bit challengeing, I love technology and learning new things so I am SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS CLASS!**
##### I did a lot of things this week, and learned a lot while doing so. For example:
###### 1. I learned how to create a proper website directory.
  - How to label files
  - And how not to label files.
  - ![Screenshot of my Directory](./images/ScreenShot1.png).



  ###### 2. Next I installed Atom and started playing around with it, trying to learn how to use it.
  - I have manged so far in using Atom
  - I installed packages and themes
  - And I've started to learn Markdown
  - I even was able to start learning HTML
     - <p> This class is quite a bit more difficult that I orginally planned.<p>
     - <p> But I really enjoy it so far.<P>
     - <p>If something is truly workth learning, it is never easy. <P>
     - <p> So will continue to struggle, and eventually succeed at web development!<p>

##### 3. Finally I learned that though this class may be hard, pateience and dedication will help me to succeed.
  - `If at first you don't succeed, try try again `

---
#### While this class is a bit challenging right now, I am confident that with time and practice I will succeed and learn the material. I may not be a master by the end, but I will have some skills in web development. I am up for the challenge!
